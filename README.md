# Metabolomics-ChagasPath

This repository contains the datasets and code used for the analysis described in the paper titled

"Changes in lipid abundance associated with disease progression and treatment response in chronic Chagas disease"

By Juan Carlos Gabald√≥n-Figueira et al.

This repository contains:

1) Original datasets:

   - *df_metaboanalyst_peaks*: A dataset with the peak intensity of each feature studied in the metabolomic analysis across all samples.
   - *metadata_chagaspath_def_qpcr_corr*: A dataset with the clinical and demographic metadata of the studied cohort.
   - *lipid_neg_df*: A dataset with the peak intensity of each feature studied in the lipidomic analysis (negatively charged) across all samples.
   - *lipid_pos_df*: A dataset with the peak intensity of each feature studied in the lipidomic analysis (psotively charged) across all samples.
   - *df_ROC_ions_corr*: A dataset with the peak intensity of features included in the multiple variable PLSDA classificator model.
  
2) R files:
   - *summary_script_def_github*: A summary script with the code used to process the datasets and plot the figures.
   - *ws_metab_onlylog10*: An R workspace including the dataframes used in the analysis.
